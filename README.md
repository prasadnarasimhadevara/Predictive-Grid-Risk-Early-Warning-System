**Predictive Grid Risk Early-Warning System (MVP)**

**Overview**

The Predictive Grid Risk Early-Warning System is an AI-driven solution designed to help Energy & Utilities companies anticipate short-term grid risks before outages occur.
The system focuses on a 24–72 hour operational horizon, enabling grid operators to move from reactive firefighting to proactive, risk-based decision making.

**Problem Statement**

Energy and Utilities operators face frequent challenges such as:

Sudden load spikes and abnormal demand patterns

Weather-driven stress on grid assets

Limited advance warning before failures or service disruptions

High operational noise from alarms with little actionable context

Most existing systems detect issues after thresholds are breached, leaving little time for preventive action and increasing outage impact and emergency maintenance costs.

**Solution Approach**

This MVP addresses the problem by combining predictive analytics with explainable AI:

Machine Learning–based load prediction forecasts near-term grid behavior (next 24–72 hours)

AI anomaly detection identifies abnormal operational stress patterns

A risk scoring engine classifies upcoming operating periods as Low / Medium / High risk

Explainability logic highlights clear risk drivers (e.g., abnormal load, rising temperature, weather impact)

Preventive action recommendations guide operators on what to do next

The system is intentionally lightweight and uses data already available in most utilities (load, time features, basic weather signals).

**What This MVP Delivers**

Near-term predictive risk visibility instead of reactive alerts

Explainable risk insights (no black-box decisions)

Focused alerts to reduce operational noise

Actionable recommendations aligned to grid operations

**Expected Business Benefits (Indicative)**

Based on industry benchmarks and operational studies, utilities adopting this approach can expect:

15–25% reduction in unplanned outage incidents through early intervention

10–20% reduction in emergency maintenance costs

5–10% improvement in reliability indices (SAIDI / SAIFI)

Better utilization of existing assets without new sensor investments

**Scope & Assumptions**

Designed for critical assets or feeders (extensible to substations)

Uses existing operational and weather data

Risk scores indicate likelihood of failure, not certainty

Thresholds and models are configurable per utility standards

**Why This Matters?**

By predicting where and when risk is building, and clearly explaining why, this system helps utilities:

Act earlier

Spend smarter

Reduce customer impact

Improve grid reliability with explainable AI

**MVP Positioning**

This solution serves as:

A proof-of-value MVP for predictive grid operations

A foundation for asset-level failure prediction

A building block for dashboards, alerts, and automated workflows
